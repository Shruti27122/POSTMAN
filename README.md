# POSTMAN


## Overview

This Git repository contains a Postman project that allows you to retrieve the locality of an area by providing a pin code. This project utilizes a web service to fetch location data based on the pin code you provide.

## Getting Started

To use this Postman project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this Git repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install Postman**: If you haven't already, download and install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) on your local machine.

3. **Import the Postman Project**:
   - Open Postman.
   - Click on the "Import" button in the top left corner.
   - Select the cloned repository directory, which contains the Postman project file (usually with a `.postman_collection.json` extension).
   - Click "Open" to import the project.

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - In Postman, you'll need to set up environment variables for this project.
   - Click on the gear icon in the top right corner (manage environments).
   - Create a new environment and add a variable for the API endpoint URL. You can name this variable `API_BASE_URL` and set its initial value to the API endpoint URL you will be using.

5. **Run the Requests**:
   - Once you have set up the environment, you can run the requests in the Postman project.
   - Select the environment you just created from the dropdown.
   - Run the "Get Locality by Pin Code" request by clicking the "Send" button.
   - The response will contain the locality information for the provided pin code.

6. **Modify the Environment**: If you need to switch to a different API endpoint or make other environment-specific changes, you can do so in the environment variables.

## Usage

1. Open the Postman project.

2. Select the environment you want to use (e.g., "Development," "Production").

3. In the "Get Locality by Pin Code" request, provide the pin code you want to query as a parameter.

4. Click the "Send" button to execute the request.

5. The response will display the locality information for the provided pin code.
